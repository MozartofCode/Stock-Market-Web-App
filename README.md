This is a stock Market Web Application that I have created using:

- pandas API (specifically the data_reader subpackage)
- streamlit library for building it as a  web app
- PIL Library for loading and manipulating images

This program gets the stock ticker and dates from the user, and then depending on the user input it displays the Close price and volume graphs
between the given dates and it displays a  table with various statistics related to the stock so that anybody can easily search stocks and
check their prices and related info
